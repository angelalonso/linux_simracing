# Simracing on Linux

## Why?
- I like racing but I cannot afford to die (or worse) on an accident, so...simulation it is.
- I like the challenge of learning how to drive fast. Learning by doing, I choose you!
- I have a Budget. 0 is that Budget right now, so I have to work with what I have around: 
  - Laptop running Linux
  - G29 steering wheel
  - A copy of GTR2 from Steam
- I also like the challenge of making stuff work on Linux. 
- Maybe someone on the interwebs can benefit from my findings as I progress on Both of the above challenges.
