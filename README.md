# HOW TO START SIMRACING ON LINUX

## Why?
I like cars, but among all the things I don't like about real cars, the danger of dying in an accident is the one I dislike the most.
I like Open Source and free games, but sometimes games done by a company are leagues above what volunteers can achieve. On the other hand, newer games require new, expensive Hardware for reasons that don't really improve the gaming so much. Right now, we have quite reallistic games that are almost entering the Abandonware bin.
I am not a good enough driver. Taking notes on how I improve is a motivation. I will also publish exercises that work well.
