- Description of this Championship:
 
 The races are 20-lap long, with no quali, so you will need to get good at:
 - Making a good rolling start from the back.
 - Overtaking a lot without risking too much.
 
 This Championship uses the 205 GTI car, on several short Circuits, on perfect weather.
 
 
 There are five races:
 - High Speed Ring
 - Monza Junior
 - Motegi Twin Ring West
 - Brands Hatch Indy
 - Suzuka East
