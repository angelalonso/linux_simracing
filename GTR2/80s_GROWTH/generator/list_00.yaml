# Learning how to put together a hotlap
- "80s_GROWTH_001 @ Hotlaps":
  - description: "Welcome to the first of the 80's Growth Championships.\n
\n 
  - About these Growth Championships:\n
\n 
    They are setup as a progression. Each Championship should gradually either increase difficulty, or add elements of complexity to practice (e.g.: Pit stops, weather).\n
    As an example, the first championships use a FWD Peugeot 205 GTI, then moves on to use a RWD Toyota AE86, both cars from the 80's (that's the 80's on 80's Growth).\n

    No one controls this, but you should try to only move on to the next championship after you won your current championship.\n
\n 
  - Description of this Championship:\n
\n 
    The races are 1-lap long, so you will need to get good at:\n
    - Making a hotlap that gets you pole position.\n
    - Standing Starts.\n
    - probably setting up your car\n
\n
    This first Championship uses the 205 GTI car, on several short Circuits, on perfect weather.\n
\n
\n
    There are five races:\n
    - High Speed Ring\n
    - Monza Junior\n
    - Motegi Twin Ring West\n
    - Brands Hatch Indy\n
    - Suzuka East\n"
