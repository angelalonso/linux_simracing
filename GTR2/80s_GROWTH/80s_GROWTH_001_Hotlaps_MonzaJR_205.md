# Hotlap at Monza Junior with a 205

 This track is the first on which you'll notice how little grip the Peugeot has on acceleration. 
You will have to learn to modulate your throttle.

## The track
You can divide the track in

    First braking point, use trail braking to get as close to the apex as possible.
    interlaced curves: your line will be a compromise of finding the apexes and getting a good speed by the start of the straight afterwards.
    parabolica: you will need to brake a bit (even use trail braking), then make the curve as fast as you can
    chicane: brake early enough, open the first turn as much as you can to start accelerating within the chicane already, and find the best line where the kerbs don't throw your car in the air.
    
## Your car
Regarding the car: focus your setup on:

    minimum fuel, tires, close ducts...as your basic setup
    aero 
    gear ratios and maximum rpms
