# Hotlap at HSR with a 205

 
 This is the simplest track, and the focus is on avoiding breaking as much as you can.
If you find it easy enough to get a good lap, start practicing Trail breaking already.
Current goal is 1:17:350

## The track
You can divide the track in 

    first banked curve: there is no need to brake, but you will need to find a good line to avoid speed dropping by the end of the curve
    second banked curve: you may need to lift while turning
    bridge to tunnel: quite a steep braking (practice your trail breaking here), then need to find a good line to get good speed into the tunnel
    last corner: can be done without braking

## Your car
Regarding the car: use this race to practice your setup on:

    gear ratio
    minimum fuel needed
    tires
    aero (mainly ducts, but also wings) for fast tracks
    save your setups as you find a good one.

A proper setup should get you to 1:15 or less
