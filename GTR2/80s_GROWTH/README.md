# What's this?

Consider this a mod to GTR2.

The idea is to have a set of championships designed to help me (or you) improve at different racing skills using some pretty nice cars from the 80s.

So far I have chosen the Peugeot 205 GTI as the entry-level car because it's FWD, and the Toyota AE86 as the next step because it is a well-behaved RWD car.

Each Championship should only be joined after winning the previous one but it's up to you.

# Development plan
- Make a fast hotlap on short tracks
  - "Failed to score any points"
  - weather on race still can be rain
  - Needs presentation and guide: Gears, low fuel, aero... link to gitlab?
    - HSR - 1:17:350
    - Monza Jr. - 1:01:7 ? (I did 1:02:6)
- Survive a Race on short tracks
- Recovery races, starting from the back -> are the current laps enough?
- Consistency races on longer tracks, regular racing weekend - Will do european tracks on Peugeot, then Asian and american ones on AE86.
- Specific Races to learn weather, pit stops...
- Step up with a faster car (GTR R32?)
- Step up with an even faster car (Porsche 962 C?) -> Race Le Mans
