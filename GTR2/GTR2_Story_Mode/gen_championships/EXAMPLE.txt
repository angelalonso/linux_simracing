Welcome to the first of the Career Championships. 

- About these Career Championships:

They are meant to be won progressively (meaning: try to take the next one ONLY after you won your current championship). 

- Description of this Championship:

This first Championship uses a FWD Car, on the HSR Circuit, on a sunny day.

The races are one-lap long, so getting the Pole position is extremely important.

There are three races:
- AI to 100%
- AI to 110%
- AI to 120%
