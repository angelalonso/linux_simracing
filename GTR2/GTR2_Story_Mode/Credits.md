# 99% of this mod is thanks to:
...the Community that has been creating Mods for decades now. I just had a look at what was available and came up with an idea, but I did not create content as such. 

Instead I glued things together.
I tried to contact some of the people behind the names and IDs below, to tell them before publishing anything, but it has been a long time for some Mods, and it's pretty hard to track people down. 

I opted for the easy path and just copied and pasted the credits from each Mod.
