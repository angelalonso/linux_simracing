# DISCLAIMER
99% of this mod is thanks to the Community that has been creating Mods for decades now. I just had a look at what was available and came up with an idea, but I did not create content as such. 

Instead I glued things together.
I tried to contact some of the people behind the names and IDs below, to tell them before publishing anything, but it has been a long time for some Mods, and it's pretty hard to track people down. 

I opted for the alternative path and just copied and pasted the credits from each Mod.

POINT BEING, that I only put things together, but each of the guys below are the real heroes!

#### Mini 2/2 (*) https://esport-racing.de/austin-mini-cooper/
Ron123 (I tried to ask for permission but it probably landed on Spam so I'll stick to the README and mention the hero)

(*) I liked the physics from the P&G's mini cooper S '69, but I found the looks and templates for Ron123's mini much more convenient. So I mixed both and somehow the result was even better (it slides a bit more than P&G's one). In any case, they are the heroes in this story.
