The Mini Cooper S dominated its capacity classes in the British Saloon Car Championship (BSCC) while it ran to Group 2 rules upto and including 1965. The move to Group 5 rules in 1966 allowed complete freedom of cylinder head and carburation, and by 1968 the Mini had an 8-port head and fuel injection, together with Dunlop's wide low-profile CR81 tyres.

For 1969, new British Leyland management decided that Abingdon should prepare and enter their race cars as well as their rally cars, leaving Cooper Cars out in the cold. However Britax sponsorship enabled Cooper to continue to race and usually beat the new works team on the tracks. To meet the challenge of the Broadspeed Escort 1300GTs, the Mini had a new shorter stroke engine to boost power, and new Dunlop CR84 tyres on 12" wheels.  Newly homologated aluminium doors, bonnet and boot-lid reduced the weight. It wasn't enough to stop Escort driver Cris Craft from winning the under 1300cc class.

This Britax-Cooper-Downton Mini was driven by Gordon Spice in the 1969 BSCC. Spice took class victories at the Brands Hatch Race of Champions Meeting, Crystal Palace Anerly Trophy, and Mallory Park.
