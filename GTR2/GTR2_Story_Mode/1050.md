1999. You smashed your first Championship!

Nah, scratch that, you absolutely bossed it and took home the win. And guess what? You're still alive and kicking.

Plus, you've landed yourself a Personal Sponsor, Mister Super Star!

Listen up, mate: This second year might see you hitting up some European Tracks.

Now, about this CheDr Ltd. After a bit of online snooping, it looks like they might be a bit dodgy, maybe even mixed up in some shady business. But hey, the season's already paid for, and it's not that different from last year, right?

But as you slip back into your usual panic mode, you start to wonder if there's a link between Richard's disappearance and CheDr. Maybe they've got some hidden agenda, and that's why they're throwing money at your hobby. 'Cause let's be real, why else would they invest in someone who's not Hamilton or Stroll?

And here's the twist: Your Sponsor isn't just keen on this Mini championship, they're eyeing up a new Touring Car championship starting next year.

So yeah, you'll be juggling races and proving yourself in a new ride.

It's a sweet problem to have, but it'll eat up all your time, leaving zilch for other gigs, hobbies, or chilling with mates.

Again, it's on you:
