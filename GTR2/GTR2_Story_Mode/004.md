# Proper Lumber

If one were to place their trust in the vast majority of films ever consumed, it would be reasonable to believe that the shy, grey, and fearful Marco had, by now, unearthed his inner bravery,  
made the love of his life love him back only to discover that his less-attractive best friend is infinitely more enjoyable company, and now the rest of the story would be focused on fixing that couple while finding another good guy for the original love of his life, to leave everyone happy.


Instead of a cinematic epiphany, Marco concluded his practice at the High Speed Ring, returned to his original body, and promptly began to vomit.  
The test had been anything but enjoyable.

It was obviously "not for him" and yet Marco couldn’t bring himself to abandon Max’s body forever, fearing that if he left it to the whims of fate, Max would die in a terrible crash.

Back in his regular life, Marco went to work, slept well, and did whatever safe, unremarkable people do when the world isn't watching. 
After a few days of recuperation, he bounced back to face the next challenge: another test run, this time at the circuit called Goodwood.

"Your car's a gem, did you clock that? Those fancy collectors would otherwise not allow us to tear up some laps at Goodwood" - Said Tom

    Here's the scoop on running a lap at Goodwood in plain English:

    Turn 1 – Madgwick:
    Start on the left side of the track, brake gently along the edge or don't brake at all.
    As you turn, focus on carrying speed through the bend.
    Aim for two apex points, adjusting your line depending on your car's setup.
    After the bend, keep left in the dry, center in the wet along the straight.

    Turn 2 – Fordwater:
    Turn from the left side, smoothly steering due to high speed.
    In the wet, avoid a puddle on the apex by running wide.
    After the turn, let the car drift to the left, keeping on power and left for stability.

    Turn 3 - St Mary’s:
    Brake gently before the slight crest, aiming for the right apex.
    Get back on the power early, moving to the middle of the track for exit.
    Brake short and firm for St Mary's part two, aiming for the apex on the right.

    Turn 4 - Lavant:
    Brake halfway between the brake and 50 board, aiming for the apex.
    Start power after the first apex, avoiding painted kerbs in the wet.
    Unwind steering and run fully left next to the green arrow board.

    Turn 5 - Kink:
    Smoothly move right, using boards to guide through the kink.
    Aim for the number 50 board for braking into Woodcote corner.

    Turn 6 – Woodcote:
    Brake at the 200 or brake board, easing off to keep left.
    Add more lock at the second red chevron for the apex on the right.
    Stay on power in third gear up to the chicane braking point.

    Turn 7 – Chicane:
    Brake short and firm, choosing a late or early turn into the chicane.
    Unwind steering after the left wall, feeding in power progressively along the right side of the track.


Just use the same setup as on High Speed Ring, and play a bit with it - Finished Tom.
