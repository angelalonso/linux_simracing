# First blood at the High Speed Ring

That night, Marco could barely sleep, in part because he had already kicked himself out several times that day, but mostly because he had quite a lot to think about. 
He still had not mastered this new skill or understood how the system worked. He had noticed time did not progress at the same pace on Max's "universe" and very bravely decided not to care about what he cannot control.

He tapped himself in the back for this and, as if intoxicated by this newly discovered courage, he went completely out of his way to decide he actually wanted a piece of that racing car adventure.
If you write your will, and then your behavior changes so much and so suddenly, your new 40-year younger, out-of-your-league spouse is legally left with nothing, but Marco's head had stopped looking at facts or statistics, which allowed the rest of his body dance naked to the tunes of "fuck it".

Back to Tom, and Marco got what everyone on a very exciting journey invariably gets first: hours of boring preparation. This was Marco though, and he really was enjoying the details.

This track's got a bit of history, virtual history, but aren't we all virtual in a way? - Said Tom, as if fiction books were not virtual enough. 

    For your first time, the most important thing is to be consistent.
    Do not worry if you are too slow, you have to learn how to be the same slow for 5 or 6 laps.
    If you need me to be specific, here is your training plan:
    - Do 10 laps before pitting first.
    - If you manage to keep the car on the tarmac, go for 15 this time.
    - If you don't, do another round of 10 laps.
    
   Once you manage 20 laps that are reasonably consistent (most of them within 0.5 seconds), go out and start working on some techniques:

   - Momentum: This is the base to driving a slow car fast, and the Mini is slow for a race car.

   Just try to brake and turn as little as you can. While you are at it, learn how to brake and turn smoothly.
   Every time you brake, you have to use your engine to get back up to speed, and the more you turn, the more you drag the motor down.

   - Use the whole track: this helps making curves wider, which needs less braking and less rotation of the steering wheel.
   Make sure you're hugging the outer edge before a turn, then swing back out to make the turn as wide as can be.
   Use visual cues on your car and steering wheel feedback to see how close you are to the track edge.
   Use the feedback from your steering wheel to see if your wheels are off the track (if your wheel supports that, like).
   - Look ahead: once you have practiced a bit your racing line, you don't need to look at the turn right in front of you.
   If your eyes look at what is coming in 1-2 seconds time, you will react faster.

   - Trailbraking: This would be a bonus at this stage if you find the previous ones easy to learn.
   In short, if you overlap and synchronize your braking and turning, you will reduce the braking distance by a lot and increase rotation.

No one proposed a Q&A session but Marco could not hold it much longer, so he asked "How many laps am I supposed to do?", which Tom ignored completely and proceeded to his next topic "Now, let's tackle the track itself..."

   Turn 1 - left:
   No need for brakes; maybe just ease off the gas a bit on exit to prevent overshooting, depending on your setup.

   Turn 2 - left:
   Bit tighter; ease off the gas, maybe drop a gear. Keep an eye on your exit.

   Turns 3 and 4 - S-bend after the bridge:
   Braking just after the bridge ends. Hug the apex to the right, then aim for a late apex on the left turn.
   This is prime time to practice using the full track and trail braking.
   Be careful not to run wide when you're entering the tunnel.

   Turn 5 - right:
   Just lift off the gas a bit to prevent overshooting on exit.

As a hapless novice navigating the bewildering realm of this particular racing track with his trusty Mini, Marco opted for a strategy of minimal intervention. 

This involved fiddling only with the essentials: loading just enough petrol to avoid an embarrassing stall, achieving a brake balance that didnâ€™t hurl him into the nearest shrubbery, and perhaps indulging in a whimsical experiment with tire pressures. 

To avoid total ignorance, he even cast a furtive glance at a few instructional videos about setting up front-wheel-drive cars, thus feigning an understanding of the broader cosmic mechanics at play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADTsFrv4YE.

Come the fateful time, Marco found himself as nervous as a cuckoo in a bag of table tennis balls. There was no tangible pressure to achieve any remarkable results, yet this was his inaugural foray onto a race track, and he was acutely aware that his learning curve would resemble a particularly vertiginous roller coaster. And he was afraid to die too.
