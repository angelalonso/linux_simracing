Your car's a gem, did you clock that? That's why those fancy collectors let us tear up some laps here at Goodwood. Bet you'll start hearing offers before we even head home.


Here's the scoop on running a lap at Goodwood in plain English:

Turn 1 – Madgwick:

    Start on the left side of the track, brake gently along the edge or don't brake at all.
    As you turn, focus on carrying speed through the bend.
    Aim for two apex points, adjusting your line depending on your car's setup.
    After the bend, keep left in the dry, center in the wet along the straight.

Turn 2 – Fordwater:

    Turn from the left side, smoothly steering due to high speed.
    In the wet, avoid a puddle on the apex by running wide.
    After the turn, let the car drift to the left, keeping on power and left for stability.

Turn 3 - St Mary’s:

    Brake gently before the slight crest, aiming for the right apex.
    Get back on the power early, moving to the middle of the track for exit.
    Brake short and firm for St Mary's part two, aiming for the apex on the right.

Turn 4 - Lavant:

    Brake halfway between the brake and 50 board, aiming for the apex.
    Start power after the first apex, avoiding painted kerbs in the wet.
    Unwind steering and run fully left next to the green arrow board.

Turn 5 - Kink:

    Smoothly move right, using boards to guide through the kink.
    Aim for the number 50 board for braking into Woodcote corner.

Turn 6 – Woodcote:

    Brake at the 200 or brake board, easing off to keep left.
    Add more lock at the second red chevron for the apex on the right.
    Stay on power in third gear up to the chicane braking point.

Turn 7 – Chicane:

    Brake short and firm, choosing a late or early turn into the chicane.
    Unwind steering after the left wall, feeding in power progressively along the right side of the track.

Now, this is where the real deal kicks in... still game?

Alright, mate, here's the deal: It's crunch time. 

If you jump into the championship and mess up the car, you're in deep trouble. And let's face it, you don't even know where the car came from. 

But if you're game, once you're finished testing at Goodwood, no matter how it goes, dive into GTR2 and kickstart the Championship named "".
