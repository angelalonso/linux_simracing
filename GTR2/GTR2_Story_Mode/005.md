# The lucky Rookie

After the chaotic whirlwind that was Goodwood's test, a towering figure, adorned in the guise of a cut-rate aristocrat, sauntered over to Marco with the intention of engaging in a bit of chitchat about the car.
Marco found himself rather disinterested in the conversation, a sentiment heightened by Tom's earlier warning about the swarm of collectors in attendance. Astute readers might already sense the impending significance of this encounter, though.

As the looming specter of the first race drew near, Marco turned to Tom in search of guidance.
Yet, all he received in return was a curt, "Figure it out on your own, mate. I'm not your personal valet." 

Marco couldn't help but find the retort rather peculiar, and thus figure it out he did. There were a set of support races for 1999's BTCC, running Minis in the hands of amateur pilots.
