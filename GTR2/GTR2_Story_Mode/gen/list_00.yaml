  - description: "Welcome to the first of the Career Championships.\n
\n 
  - About these Career Championships:\n
\n 
    They are setup as a progression. Each Championship should gradually either increase difficulty, or add elements of complexity to practice (e.g.: Pit stops, weather).\n
    As an example, the first championships use a FWD Alfa Romeo 147 GT-R, then moves on to use a RWD BMW E46 M3.\n

    No one controls this, but you should try to only move on to the next championship after you won your current championship.\n
\n 
  - Description of this Championship:\n
\n 
    The races are 1-lap long, so you will need to get good at:\n
    - Making a hotlap that gets you pole position.\n
    - Standing Starts.\n
    - probably setting up your car\n
\n
    This first Championship uses the Alfa Romeo 147 GT-R car, on several short Circuits, on perfect weather.\n
\n

    - High Speed Ring\n
    - Monza Junior\n
    - Motegi Twin Ring West\n
