# Episode 1

The year is 1999.

Your phone rings loudly, and it's Richard, one of your karting buddies.

![Go Karts, as perceived by AI](imgs/go-karts_1.jpeg)

"Check your mailbox... I left you something... do as you please with it." His speech is strained, and he seems unwilling to engage with your inquiries. He abruptly ends the call, leaving you with the sense that he's gone.

Ah, Richard, always a bit enigmatic! He chooses to vanish, leaving behind an envelope containing a set of car keys and an address. You arrive at the location and confirm that under a cloth cover there is indeed a car, and not just any car, but a vintage Mini Cooper!

Numerous thoughts race through your mind. Is there a catch? Will the car start? Since when did Richard possess a classic car? Eager to confirm your gut feeling, you try to call him, but the number is no longer reachable.

You slide into the driver's seat, look around, and discover the car is actually race-prepped. You turn the key and confirm the engine's roar is far too loud for city streets. What a sound!

You drive to Rich's place, torn between not wanting to be the noisy neighbor and yearning to hear that engine roar. There is nobody at home. Could it really be that Rich is completely gone? You're struck by your stroke of luck. However, practical considerations soon come into play, prompting you to weigh your options.

The car could fetch a substantial sum if sold, enabling you to acquire something more economical. A brief online search confirms the escalating value of vintage cars. Yet, you hesitate, unsure of Richard's potential return. Perhaps it's wise to delay any decisions.

As you sift through the glove box for service records, you make another discovery.

It appears Richard had entered the car into a championship. Who would have guessed he harbored such aspirations? Nonetheless, Richard always kept to himself, leaving others to speculate about his secrets.

Moreover, the paperwork indicates that the championship has yet to commence, with a provided contact number. The individual on the other end sounds annoyed, reminding you that no refunds are available for non-attendance.

Could this present an opportunity for you to participate in the championship? Rich told you to do as you please with the car, so you could give it a try, and if he changes his mind and shows up, you can simply hand him the keys.

However, doubts begin to creep in. The car is likely registered in Rich's name, might people suspect something is awry? The prospect of scrutiny and potential judgment starts to weigh heavily on your mind. What if the car has something to do with Rich's disappearance? Would you also have to disappear?

------------------------------------------
Excitement mingles with apprehension as you contemplate the daunting challenge ahead.

You see, you are no seasoned racer. In fact, you have never even set foot on a racing track other than your local go-Kart ring before. 
The idea of competing against seasoned veterans in a high-stakes championship seems both exhilarating and terrifying.

But also know that this opportunity is too precious to pass up. With a determined glint in your eye, you make a decision.

Rather than diving headfirst into the championship without any experience, you resolve to hone your skills first. It may be a good idea to give the most seasoned guy from your go-karting days, Tom, a call. You also decide to not tell him about the whole Rich story.

    Ah, you've struck gold, mate! How on earth did you manage to nab such an opportunity? 
    Never mind, I probably don't want to know – likely involves a story with an older lady or something equally wild.

    But hey, let's focus! What's important now is that you've called me up. Let's get down to business and start with the basics. 

![Tom, as perceived by AI](imgs/tom_1.jpg)

    Have you had a chance to take that car out for a spin yet? Oh, wait, you just got it, didn't you? 
    Well, no worries, mate, we'll need to rack up some miles before the Championship kicks off anyway.

    I happen to know a few lads who've got access to a nice track – perfect for newbies like yourself, and if you impress there, who knows? Maybe you'll be strutting your stuff at Goodwood before you know it.

    But, you know the deal – nothing comes for free. 
    I want to be your race engineer for the entire season, and trust me, you'll want my expertise, so I'll need the odd joyride in that motor when the mood strikes me.


------------------------------------------
    Now, onto the High Speed Ring.

    This track's got a bit of history, even if it's all in the virtual realm. But hey, aren't we all virtual in a way?

    Right, let's get into the nitty-gritty of driving a slow car fast: momentum. That means braking as little as possible and maximizing your turn exits to avoid dragging the motor down.

    You'll want to try your hand at some key techniques. To get the most out of it, focus on nailing one thing at a time until it's second nature:

![A GT race driver, as perceived by AI](imgs/gt_race_driver.jpg)

    First off, consistency.
        Aim for at least 15 laps before pitting again.
        Warm up your tires and improve your lap times gradually as the fuel runs down.
        Try to keep your lap times consistent over 5-6 laps (they don't need to be lightning fast).
    Make the most of the whole track.
        Make sure you're hugging the outer edge before a turn, then swing back out to make the turn as wide as can be.
        Use visual cues to see how close you are to the track edge.
        Use the feedback from your steering wheel to see if your wheels are off the track (if your wheel supports that, like).
    Look ahead.
        Check out this video for some tips: [link to video].
    Get practicing with trail braking.
        Watch these videos for pointers: [links to videos].

    Now, let's tackle the track itself...

![A race track, as perceived by AI](imgs/racetrack_1.jpg)
    Turn 1 - right:
    No need for brakes; maybe just ease off the gas a bit on exit to prevent overshooting, depending on your setup.

    Turn 2 - right:
    Bit tighter; ease off the gas, maybe drop a gear. Keep an eye on your exit.

    Turns 3 and 4 - S-bend after the bridge:
    Braking just after the bridge ends. Hug the apex, then aim for a late apex on the left turn.
    This is prime time to practice using the full track and trail braking.
    Be careful not to run wide when you're entering the tunnel.

    Turn 5 - right:
    Just lift off the gas a bit to prevent overshooting on exit.

Given the track layout and the Mini's characteristics, you should focus your setup on only loading the amount of gas you need, find a comfortable brake balance, and perhaps experiment with tire pressures.

One last thing: You might notice I'm pretty fussy about brake temperatures. When I start panicking, I'll be yelling at you to cool them brakes down. Has a bit to do with me old man, how he passed away and all. Ignore the shouting but keep them brakes below 500 degrees, please."


When the day arrives, you literally slept 3 hours maximum. There is no pressure for results, but it is your first time on a race track and you know there is a lot of basic stuff you will be learning.


Click on...

------------------------------------------
That was an interesting test, and you know what I mean by interesting.

It's going to be hard to focus on the next test track, but you must, because Goodwood is a perfect fit for that Mini.

Welcome to High Speed Ring

This mega-secret track has a bit of history, but it's all in the virtual realm. We're all virtual and all, aren't we?

You'll learn the most crucial thing when driving a slow car fast: momentum. That means braking as little as possible and opening your exits to avoid excessive friction that slows the car down.

In short: you must be smooth, smooth braking, smooth turning and, sometimes, even smooth on the gas.

You should probably also try your hand at some of the most important techniques. For maximum effectiveness, you should focus on one technique only each time, until they become natural:
- Get consistent.
  - For this, you should probably only get to the track for a minimum of 15 laps before pitting again.
  - Warm your wheels up, and progressively improve your lap times as the fuel weight gets lower and lower.
  - Try to get almost the same lap time for 5-6 consecutive laps (not necessarily fast laps)
- Use the whole track, meaning, for instance, that you get to the leftmost border before a right turn, and then go back to the leftmost border on your way out to make the turn as open as possible.
  - Find a reference for your car view to the border of the track.
  - Use your steering wheel's feedback to find out where the wheels are actually outside of the track (if your wheel supports it)
- Look way ahead, as explained here:
  - https://youtu.be/WO-URMCm7SI?t=60
- Trail braking, check the following videos out:

  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUdaWbr1KB4
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxIanjfmGDY
 
Now, onto the track itself...

Turn 1 - right:

    No brakes needed, maybe ease off the gas on exit to avoid overshooting, depending on your setup.
 
Turn 2 - right:

    Tighter, so ease off the gas, maybe downshift.
    Watch your exit.
 
Turns 3, 4 - S-bend after the bridge:

    Only spot where you'll need to brake. Start braking just after the bridge ends, hug the apex, then aim for a late apex on the left turn.
    This is the best turn to practice using the whole track and trail braking.
    Mind not to run wide entering the tunnel.
   
 
Turn 5 - right:

    Just lift slightly to prevent overshooting on exit.


Now, about that mini...

Driving an Austin Mini Cooper around Goodwood Circuit requires a combination of skill, precision, and understanding of the car's characteristics. Here are some tips to help you drive the Mini Cooper fast around Goodwood:

    Smooth Driving: The Mini Cooper is a lightweight car with responsive handling. Smooth driving inputs are crucial to maintain momentum through corners and straights.

    Braking Points: Identify the braking points for each corner. Goodwood has several fast corners where you'll need to brake early and progressively to avoid locking up the wheels.

    Cornering Technique: Use a late apex approach for most corners to maximize exit speed. The Mini Cooper has excellent agility, so you can carry good speed through the corners. Be careful not to oversteer, especially in tighter corners like Fordwater and St. Mary's.

    Throttle Control: The Mini Cooper's engine is relatively small, so precise throttle control is essential for maintaining speed, especially when exiting corners. Smoothly apply the throttle to avoid wheelspin and maintain traction.

    Use the Curbs: Goodwood has some curbs that you can use to your advantage, especially in faster corners like Madgwick and Lavant. However, be cautious not to hit them too aggressively, as it can upset the car's balance.

    Learn the Track: Familiarize yourself with the layout of the Goodwood Circuit. Practice different lines and braking points to find the optimal racing line for your Mini Cooper.

    Manage Momentum: The Mini Cooper's lightweight design means it's sensitive to changes in speed. Focus on carrying momentum through corners rather than relying solely on brute acceleration on straights.

    Stay Smooth and Consistent: Consistency is key to setting fast lap times. Avoid sudden movements or aggressive inputs that can unsettle the car. Smooth and consistent driving will help you maintain control and extract the most performance from the Mini Cooper.

    Practice: Like any racing endeavor, practice is crucial. Spend time on the track to refine your driving technique, experiment with different setups, and gradually improve your lap times.

By following these tips and practicing regularly, you can drive the Austin Mini Cooper fast around Goodwood Circuit and enjoy the unique driving experience that this iconic car and historic track offer.



Given the track layout and the limitations of the Mini, your setup should aim to have just the fuel you need, find a brake balance you're comfortable with, and perhaps experiment with tire pressures.

One more thing: You'll find I'm quite particular about brake temperatures. Whenever I ask, just make sure they stay below 500 degrees. Even if I scream. "Cool brakes, your brakes are overheating" is also the last  thing my father said before he passed away, so don't judge me.

Now, dive into the championship named "HSR test", and then [click here when you are done, regardless of how it goes, to have a go at Goodwood](./2877.md)
-------------------------------
Your car's a gem, did you clock that? That's why those fancy collectors let us tear up some laps here at Goodwood. Bet you'll start hearing offers before we even head home.


Here's the scoop on running a lap at Goodwood in plain English:

Turn 1 – Madgwick:

    Start on the left side of the track, brake gently along the edge or don't brake at all.
    As you turn, focus on carrying speed through the bend.
    Aim for two apex points, adjusting your line depending on your car's setup.
    After the bend, keep left in the dry, center in the wet along the straight.

Turn 2 – Fordwater:

    Turn from the left side, smoothly steering due to high speed.
    In the wet, avoid a puddle on the apex by running wide.
    After the turn, let the car drift to the left, keeping on power and left for stability.

Turn 3 - St Mary’s:

    Brake gently before the slight crest, aiming for the right apex.
    Get back on the power early, moving to the middle of the track for exit.
    Brake short and firm for St Mary's part two, aiming for the apex on the right.

Turn 4 - Lavant:

    Brake halfway between the brake and 50 board, aiming for the apex.
    Start power after the first apex, avoiding painted kerbs in the wet.
    Unwind steering and run fully left next to the green arrow board.

Turn 5 - Kink:

    Smoothly move right, using boards to guide through the kink.
    Aim for the number 50 board for braking into Woodcote corner.

Turn 6 – Woodcote:

    Brake at the 200 or brake board, easing off to keep left.
    Add more lock at the second red chevron for the apex on the right.
    Stay on power in third gear up to the chicane braking point.

Turn 7 – Chicane:

    Brake short and firm, choosing a late or early turn into the chicane.
    Unwind steering after the left wall, feeding in power progressively along the right side of the track.

In terms of setup, the same as on High Speed Ring should be a good base, but you have to play with it and find out.

1999. You smashed your first Championship!

Nah, scratch that, you absolutely bossed it and took home the win. And guess what? You're still alive and kicking.

Plus, you've landed yourself a Personal Sponsor, Mister Super Star!

Listen up, mate: This second year might see you hitting up some European Tracks.

Now, about this CheDr Ltd. After a bit of online snooping, it looks like they might be a bit dodgy, maybe even mixed up in some shady business. But hey, the season's already paid for, and it's not that different from last year, right?

But as you slip back into your usual panic mode, you start to wonder if there's a link between Richard's disappearance and CheDr. Maybe they've got some hidden agenda, and that's why they're throwing money at your hobby. 'Cause let's be real, why else would they invest in someone who's not Hamilton or Stroll?

And here's the twist: Your Sponsor isn't just keen on this Mini championship, they're eyeing up a new Touring Car championship starting next year.

So yeah, you'll be juggling races and proving yourself in a new ride.

It's a sweet problem to have, but it'll eat up all your time, leaving zilch for other gigs, hobbies, or chilling with mates.

Again, it's on you:

- Do you want to switch your Instagram profile to "former race champion".
- [, or do you still fancy getting down and dirty in the races.](./14963.md)

You tend to be a realistic guy, and so you take a year off your job to become a semi-professional race driver, because of course you do!

This year's race calendar looks as follows:
