Alright mate, you lucky bugger, how'd you land a catch like that? Nevermind, forget I asked, probably an older lady or something.

Anyway, what matters now is you've pulled a sick move calling me up.

Let's get going with the basics, have you taken that car out for a spin yet? Ah, no, you said you just got it... You definitely need to get some miles on it before the Championship kicks off.

Good thing I know some folks who've got a secret track, perfect for beginners. And if you do well there, maybe you could even strut your stuff at Goodwood.

But remember, everything comes with a price: You let me be your race engineer for the whole season AND I get to take the car for a spin whenever I feel like it.
