Hey mate, you freaking lucky bastard, how did you get a cutie like that? Nevermind, you zerozerosemen, it probably belonged a gilf or something.

Non-important! What is important now is that you are a clever boy, calling me and all.

Have you raced that thing already? Ah, no, you said you just got it... You MUST race that thing before the Championship starts.

Luckily for you, I know people on a super-secret track, that is tailor-made for newbies. Then if you do well, I guess you can also try showing off at Goodwood.

Everything has a price though: You'll let me be your race engineer the whole season AND I can take the car for some laps whenever I want.
