1999. You survived your first Championship!
I meant to say that you WON your first Championship. And you are alive.

You also found a Personal Sponsor, Mister Super Star!

NOTE: this second year may be about moving on to European Tracks

The company is called CheDr Ltd. A bit of googling leaves you with the impression that the company may either be a scam or a full-fledged money laundry. On the other hand, this season has already been paid for, and it is not that different from what happened last year right?

As you return to your regular Panic state, you realize that maybe there is a connection between Richard's disappearance and CheDr, that maybe the company has a hidden agenda, and that is why they are interested on giving you money for your hobby, because at the end of the day, something has to justify spending money on someone who is neither Hamilton nor Stroll.

There is a little "situation" though. Your Sponsor is not only interested on this Mini championship, but on a new Touring Car championship that will start next year.

This means that, on top of your races, you will be testing that you have what it takes to drive that new car.

That's a nice problem to have, but it will leave you no time for other jobs, hobbies or socializing.

Again, your call
