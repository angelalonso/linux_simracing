Well done on turning a profit from a mate's misfortune with the local Mob!

You're buzzing, can't wait for the first race weekend to roll in. You've scrutinized your motor inside-out a thousand times, driven to different tracks countless times... you've just discovered that racing pumps life into your veins! You're so fixated on the whole deal that you start panicking because your second year hasn't been paid for! And the package you're about to dive into isn't exactly budget-friendly.

What were you thinking? No proper racer would compete for just one year and then vanish! Now you're cursing your ex-friend for not coughing up for a second year in advance. Brilliant! You'll either have to sell your soul to the Devil or snag a sponsor if you want to keep racing next year.

Alright, let's take a deep breath and stop whinging, need to focus on this year's race calendar for now.

The championship runs on the same tracks and days as the official BTCC:

    13 April Thruxton
    26 April Silverstone
    04 May Donington
    17 May Brands Hatch
    25 May Oulton Park
    14 June Donington
    28 June Croft
    26 July Snetterton
    02 August Thruxton
    16 August Knockhill
    31 August Brands Hatch
    13 September Oulton Park
    20 September Silverstone

But before the season kicks off, you reckon it might be wise to get some assistance. Your mate Tom's more of a car nut than you'll ever be. Then again, he might be green-eyed that you've landed Rich's riches.

What's the call?
