The scene is '98.

You (obviously) got a thing for fast motors, spent your whole youth thrashing about with your mates at the local go-Kart Track.

Your blower blares, it's Richard, one of your Karting mates.

"I...won't be back...for a while. Check your postbox...left you something...do what you want. It's no use to me now anyways." The bloke could barely talk, probably not listening to your questions. Then he cuts the line and, by the sounds of it, torched his phone, 'cause there's no chance of reaching him.

Ah, good old Richard, always a bit dodgy! Dodgy as in skipping town in a hurry, and somehow fancying you, 'cause he left an envelope with a set of car keys and an address. You rock up there and peel back the nylon cloth: it's a Mini Cooper S 1275!

Loads of thoughts swarm your noggin. Is there a catch? Will the motor fire up? Since when did Richard drive a classic? Does the motor have anything to do with Rich scarpering?

You hop in, crank it up... It's alive!

You're proper gobsmacked by your luck. Then you settle down, get your head straight, and start weighing up the options.

This thing's probably worth a pretty penny, maybe you could flog it and bag something cheaper. A quick scroll through the web reveals it'd be a savvy move, vintage motors are fetching more cash by the minute. But then again, what if Richard comes back and wants his motor back? Better hold off a couple months before flogging it, maybe even score more dosh.

As you rummage for the service records in the glove box, you stumble upon another booklet.

Seems Richard the Great (that's what you've dubbed him now) had signed the motor up for some Championship. Never let on he was such a pro...but then again, he didn't chat much, and we're all pondering why he had to vanish.

But hold up, there's more! The papers are for a Championship that ain't kicked off yet. There's a number on the booklet. Bloke on the line's fuming, "So you're not showing up? Remember: no refunds." Seems the whole entry and fees were paid upfront.

Could take the motor out for a spin yourself, right?

Then you start thinking downbeat like usual: people might give you the side-eye, figure something's off, start prying about the owner... and probably push you harder than Albon in a RedBull F1 car. You (or your ego) might take a hit.

So, what's the call? Pick:

- [Let's do this! Once dreamed I was the next Max Verstappen, gotta mean something, yeah?](./10871.md)
- [I reckon I should sell the motor. Richard said I could do what I wanted with it, right?](./14045.md)
