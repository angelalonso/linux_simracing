Welcome to High Speed Ring

This ultra-secret track has some history, but it's all virtual history. We are all virtual after all, no?

You will learn the most important thing when driving a slow car fast: keep momentum. For that, you need to avoid braking as much as you can, and also open each turn to the maximum, to avoid friction that will brake the car too.

Now, about the track itself...

The first right turn must be taken without braking. You may need to coast the car a bit on the exit to avoid running wide, but that depends on your setup.
The second right turn is sharper and you will need to at least coast, maybe even go down a gear. Again, attention to the exit.
The S after the bridge are the only place where you need to brake. Start braking right after the end of the bridge, get close to the apex, then move to a late apex on the left turn, trying not to run wide as you enter the tunnel.
The last turn to the right just requires that you coast a little bit to, again, avoid running wide on the exit.

Knowing how the track looks like, and the limitations of that Mini, your setup needs to be as light on gas as possible, test the brake balance you feel more comfortable with, and maybe also play with the tire pressures.


One last thing: I tend to be very specific with the brakes temperature. Whenever I ask you, just check that they remain below 500 degrees.

Now get to the championship named ""
