Welcome to High Speed Ring

This mega-secret track has a bit of history, but it's all in the virtual realm. We're all virtual after all, aren't we?

You'll learn the most crucial thing when driving a slow car fast: maintaining momentum. That means minimizing braking as much as possible and maximizing your turn exits to avoid excessive friction that slows the car down.

Now, onto the track itself...

    First right turn: No brakes needed, maybe ease off the gas on exit to avoid overshooting, depending on your setup.
    Second right turn: Tighter, so ease off the gas, maybe downshift. Watch your exit.
    S-bend after the bridge: Only spot where you'll need to brake. Start braking just after the bridge ends, hug the apex, then aim for a late apex on the left turn. Mind not to run wide entering the tunnel.
    Final right turn: Just ease off the gas slightly to prevent overshooting on exit.

Given the track layout and the limitations of the Mini, your setup should aim to conserve fuel, find a brake balance you're comfortable with, and perhaps experiment with tire pressures.

One more thing: You'll find I'm quite particular about brake temperatures. Whenever I ask, just make sure they stay below 500 degrees.

Now, dive into the championship named "", and then [click here when you are done, regardless of how it goes](./2877.md)
