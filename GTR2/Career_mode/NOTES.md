Tracks
-----
HSR - too boring for alfa, but very good first "get your hot lap, then run one lap" 1:19
Monza Junior - Up there with HSR, less turns but more "pure"
Twin Ring Motegi - Extremely short, good for learning but not so easy to get hot lap
Watkins Glen - Nicer than HSR, harder to get hotlap but not undoable 1:22
DTM Brands hatch indy - same-ish level to Watkins Glen but its shorter. Harder to pass than on WG 0:52
Suzuka East - Very good, definitely hardest half-circuits to get pole - very nice races when need to pass 0:56
Oulton Park Forsters - Harder than Suzuka East, not so easy to get pole but ok 1:07
Hockenheim Short - flat, technical, proper GP...maybe too long?, better for learning whole hockenheim?
Barcelona National 2006, 2016 - very nice, difficult to master, maybe too longe but good
