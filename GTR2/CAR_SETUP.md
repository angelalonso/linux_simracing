  - Tires
    - Common sense
  - Radiator opening
    - Start with minimum, check that temperatures dont go over 100°
  - Rev limit
    - Start with maximum, check that temperatures dont go over 100°
  - Fuel quantity
    - Common sense
- 1: Gear Box
  - Engine reaches rev limits in the longest straight in 6th gear
    - Lengthen 6th gear and re-arrange 2nd to 5th gear to get even spacing between 1st & 6th gear
  - Engine does not reach rev limits in the longest straight in 6th gear
    - Shorten 6th gear and re-arrange 2nd to 5th gear to get even spacing between 1st & 6th gear
- 2: Brake duct opening
  - Brake temperature gets lower than 300°C in the straights
    - Lower duct opening
  - Brake temperature goes over 600°C  while braking
    - Higher duct opening
- 3: Camber and Tire Pressure initials
  - Interior Tire Temperature - Exterior Tire Temperature < 0°C
    - Increase negative camber
  - Interior Tire Temperature - Exterior Tire Temperature > 0°C
    - Decrease negative camber
  - Center of tire Colder than Exterior and Interior Tire Temperature
    - Increase Tire Pressure
  - Center of tire Warmer than Exterior and Interior Tire Temperature
    - Decrease Tire Pressure
- 4: Brake Bias
  - Front wheels lock first while braking (Tendency for the car to go straight off track)
    - Adjust bias towards rear
  - Rear wheels lock first while braking (Tendency for the car to spin)
    - Adjust bias towards front
- 5: Steering lock
  - Steering reaches the end stop in the sharpest turn
    - Increase Steering Lock
  - Steering at 50% in the sharpest turn
    - Decrease Steering Lock
- 6: Differential
  - DIFFERENTIAL POWER
    - Good propulsion but car understeers under power
      - Decrease power
    - Lack of propulsion exiting corners
      - Increase power
  - DIFFERENTIAL COAST
    - Stable braking but lift off understeer
      - Decrease coast
    - Unstable braking, lift off oversteer
      - Increase coast
  - DIFFERENTIAL PRELOAD
    - Car too nervous transitioning from braking / Acceleration
      - Decrease preload
    - car not enough responsive transitioning from braking / Acceleration
      - Increase preload
- 7: Aero
  - SPLITTER
    - Fast track (type Enna Pergusa or Monza)
      - Front splitter at 1
    - All other tracks
      - Front splitter at 2
  - WING
    - Understeering car in a fast curve (more than 120 kph)
      - Decrease rear wing
    - Oversteering car in a fast curve (more than 120 kph) (slightly is good, though)
      - Increase rear wing
