First of all, I did not put together any of the Tracks and Cars.

Each of them includes a Readme with the credits. The guys behind those mods are the real heroes here, so go have a look!

Still, I tried to get permission to use each Mod: 
- Cars:
BMW E46 - Got the files from KBB, then asked Sidstalker specifically for permission through a PM on the Trackaholics Forum.
Alfa 147 - I tried to look for Indiana on Trackaholics, KBB and some other forums. I could not find the guy, please check the ReadMe for Credits.

- Tracks:
