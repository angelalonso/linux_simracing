Welcome to the first of the Career Championships.
 
 - About these Career Championships:
 
 They are setup as a progression. Each Championship should gradually either increase difficulty, or add elements of complexity to practice (e.g.: Pit stops, weather).
 As an example, the first championships use a FWD Alfa Romeo 147 GT-R, then moves on to use a RWD BMW E46 M3.

No one controls this, but you should try to only move on to the next championship after you won your current championship.
 
 - Description of this Championship:
 
 The races are 1-lap long, so you will need to get good at:
 - Making a hotlap that gets you pole position.
 - Standing Starts.
 - probably setting up your car
 
 This first Championship uses the Alfa Romeo 147 GT-R car, on several short Circuits, on perfect weather.
 
 
 There are five races:
 - High Speed Ring
 - Monza Junior
 - Motegi Twin Ring West
 - Brands Hatch Indy
 - Suzuka East
